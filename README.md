Flask-App-Structure

This is the basic flask app structure for larger applications
which I use in my projects.
This structure follows lots of advice from here
https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/wiki/Large-app-how-to
and here
http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/22/

Dependencies of the code:
Flask-Manager
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.0
sqlit3
sqlit3 /tmp/record.db schema.sql
pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple some-package
